### Mutability/Immutability

TODO: struct mutability, struct deep mutability

By **default** variables are immutable. And it should be your default choice. Immutability means that you cannot change value.

This will not _even_ compile:

```rust
let x = 5;
x = 6; // error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
```

To make this piece of code correct we need to make variable mutable:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
x = 6;
```

> There are multiple trade-offs to consider in addition to the prevention of bugs. For example, in cases where you’re using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances. With smaller data structures, creating new instances and writing in a more functional programming style may be easier to think through, so lower performance might be a worthwhile penalty for gaining that clarity.

Use mutability when:

* it leads to more manageable and clean code (relatively rare case)
* you need more performance

**Note:** when discovering new Rust type - pay attention to what immutability means for this type.

### Constants

> ...you aren’t allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable.

> You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated.

> Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

> ...constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.

> Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words, and underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

**Note:** `let mut` makes runtime immutable data. `const` makes compile-time data.

## Shadowing

**Note:** using shadowing you can "update" a value binded to _variable name_. But it will be a new data which still makes things safe in the context of parallelism.

```rust
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;
let x = x * 2;
x = x + 3 // <- this is still incorrect
```

You can change a type also:

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

Mutable variables have fixed type:

```rust
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len(); // error[E0308]: mismatched types
```

### Data Types

> Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

Type definition for variables:

[`let` reference](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.44.0/std/keyword.let.html)

```rust
let variable_name: variable_type = variable_value;
```

You can omit type part if it can be inferred by compiler:

```rust
let x = "i am string";
```

#### Integers

* Fixed size, unsigned: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`
* Fixed size, signed: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`
* Architecture specific: `usize`, `isize` (64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture)

> Note that all number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, and `_` as a visual separator, such as `1_000`.

```rust
x = 98_222;     // Decimal
x = 0xff;       // Hex
x = 0o77;       // Octal
x = 0b1111_0000 // Binary
x = b'A';       // Byte (u8 only)
```

> So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you’re unsure, Rust’s defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to i32: this type is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which you’d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

**Note:** `usize` used for indexing because architecture is related memory address representation. (?)

> When you’re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to panic at runtime if this behavior occurs.

> When you’re compiling in release mode with the --release flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two’s complement wrapping. In short, values greater than the maximum value the type can hold “wrap around” to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of a `u8`, `256` becomes `0`, `257` becomes `1`, and so on. The program won’t panic, but the variable will have a value that probably isn’t what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error. If you want to wrap explicitly, you can use the standard library type [`Wrapping`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.Wrapping.html).

#### Floating-Point Types

* `f32` - 32-bit float-point
* `f64` - 64-bit float-point

> Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.

> The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision.

[IEEE-754 standard Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).

Numeric Operations:

> Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. The following code shows how you’d use each one in a let statement:

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

#### The Boolean Type

> As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

#### The Character Type

> Rust’s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive. However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a char is in Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in “Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings” in Chapter 8.

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'ℤ';
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
```

#### Compound Types: Tuple

> A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```

> we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

```rust
let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup; // destructuring like in JS
```

> we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to access.

```rust
let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let five_hundred = x.0; // get value by index
let six_point_four = x.1;
```

#### Compound Types: Array

> Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.

> Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in Chapter 4) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably use a vector. Chapter 8 discusses vectors in more detail.

Examples:

```rust
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
              
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // type definition consists of element type and size

let a = [3; 5]; // creates 5-elements array and fills it with `3`: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = a[0]; // access by index (index is usize)
let second = a[1];
```

Accessing by invalid index leads to panic:

> The compilation didn’t produce any errors, but the program resulted in a runtime error and didn’t exit successfully. When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the array length, Rust will panic.

> This is the first example of Rust’s safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust’s error handling.

**Note:** it prevents many exploit techniques: a lot of exploits are using "out of boundaries" memory access to corrupt, substitute or steal the data.

### Functions

> the main function ... is the entry point of many programs.

> Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names.

[`fn` reference](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.44.0/std/keyword.fn.html)

Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

> In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what you mean.
