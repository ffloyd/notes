# Chapters 1-2

## [0. Introductions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

`edition="2018"` must be used today. Some old Rust code may use 2015 edition. Modern compiler still supports 2015 edition.

`rustup docs --book` opens Rust Book locally if `rustup` is installed.

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) also provides [safe parallelism](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/processes.html), but doing it in a different way
which is impossible in vanilla Rust. And Rust way seems to be impossible in Elixir.
But Rust gives you much more control and freedom than Elixir.

It's just a trait of a well adopted common purpose language like C++, C# or Java.
More focused languages like Elixir/Ruby can provide more advantages in a specific area, but definetely lacks flexibility.
And I haven't found a really good Rust library for native desktop applications.
[Game Development engines & libraries](https://arewegameyet.com/) are presented in the ecosystem, but still young and not very mature.
So, Rust is not absolutely universal language, no miracles here.

What makes Rust really shine - is that the language abstractions allows both low-level programming and high-level one (like WEB-development).
You can do WEB-development in C++, but it is not comfortable. Rust can provide you a much more comfortable web development ([Rocket framework as an example](https://rocket.rs/)).

I think Rust have such advantages because of macro system. Similar thing happened with `Erlang` -> `Elixir`. Like C++, Erlang has no macro system.
Elixir's macros and Rust macros share the same ideas and inspired by [Lisp macro](http://wiki.c2.com/?LispMacro).
And both [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) are getting most of expressiveness from macros. 

Also, Rust is compiled to binaries. It means that, unlike Ruby or JS, you should think about you hardware and target OS.
There can be platform-specific pitfalls and limitations.

## [1. Getting Started](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)

`rustup` is preferrable way to install Rust. Seems that's it's better not to use Homebrew even to install `rustup`.
Don't forget to update your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` like it described in instruction.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Execute `rustup update` from time to time to be on an actual toolchain version.

`rustup doc` -> `Rust by Example` - is a good way to remember things without rereading a lot of text.

Hello World:

```rust
fn main() { // entrypoint function
    println!("Hello, world!"); // it's a macro, not function
}
```

Compilation without Cargo:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

Basic Cargo usage:

`cargo new project_name` - create simple project structure.

`Cargo.toml` - project configuration file. Similar to `package.json` in JS world.

Essential commands:

* `cargo build` 
* `cargo update`
* `cargo run`
* `cargo check`
* `cargo build --release`

Run `cargo -h` or `cargo [command] -h` to get help.

## [2. Programming a Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

Final `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
edition = "2018"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
rand = "0.5.5"
```

Final `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use rand::Rng; // _external_ crate `rand` used here

use std::cmp::Ordering; // alias to `Ordering` enum type
use std::io; // alias to `io` namespace

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!"); // ! - because this is macro

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); // `secret_number` is immutable.

    loop { // known as `while(true)` in some other languages
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        let mut guess = String::new(); // `guess` is mutable

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess) // http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.43.1/std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line
            .expect("Failed to read line"); // http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.43.1/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() { // Pattern Matching! http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.43.1/std/keyword.match.html
            Ok(num) => num, // it works close to JS here: `let { num } = someObject;`
            Err(_) => continue, // `_` used when we don't want to assign the value to a new local variable
        };

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess); // like string extrapolation in Ruby, but with compile-time optimizations

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { // Pattern Matching!
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
